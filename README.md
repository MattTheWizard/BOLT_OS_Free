# BOLT_OS_Free
This is the Free version of the BOLT OS to make (almost) any electric foam dart blaster truly electrifying. By providing select fire functionality.

This is the free version with the following features:
* Reliable and fast code for super snappy response
* Support for a 2 position selector switch
* Choose between single fire and full auto

There is also a premium version with even more awesome features:
* Semi / Semi Binary / 2 rnd Burst / 3 rnd Burst/ 5 rnd Burst / Full auto support
* Complete freedom in combination of firemodes (Yes, you can have double burst, or semi and binary semi)
* Rate of fire reduction, 0 - 5 (get super snappy semi auto with a fast motor, but don't go through a mag in 1 second on full auto)
* pusher crash detection (to make sure you don't accidentally burn out your pusher motor).
* Easily adjustable hardware settings via the selector switch and rev trigger. No other buttons, LCD or laptop needed!
